FRAUD DETECTION IN TRANSACTIONS: BUILDING AN ANDROID APP WITH MACHINE LEARNING FOR REAL-TIME FRAUD ANALYSIS


                                                           Abstract:
This application provides a secure platform for managing and transferring funds through credit card transactions. The primary feature of the application is the ability to transfer money to other users by searching through their names or mobile numbers. Each transaction is meticulously recorded and authenticated to ensure security and accountability. An initial transaction is added to the database as default, and subsequent transactions are processed by loading previous transaction data for fraud detection. Machine learning models, including Random Forest, XGBoost, and an Ensemble model, are employed to verify the transaction status (fraud or real). If a transaction is flagged as fraudulent, it is halted immediately. The system incorporates robust authentication measures to protect user data and financial activities while maintaining a comprehensive transaction log for transparency.

SYSTEM ANALYSIS
Existing System:
The existing system for credit card transaction management primarily focuses on handling payments and transfers between users. Typically, these systems rely on centralized databases and conventional fraud detection algorithms to manage and monitor transactions. Authentication methods such as password-based login and basic encryption are often employed to safeguard user data. However, many of these systems face limitations in detecting fraudulent transactions in real-time due to their reliance on rule-based models, which can be easily bypassed by sophisticated fraud tactics. Fraud detection systems in existing platforms may not always leverage machine learning to dynamically learn from transaction data, resulting in false positives or undetected fraud attempts. Furthermore, the lack of real-time monitoring in some systems makes them vulnerable to financial crimes, as fraudulent activities may only be detected after significant losses occur. Transaction logs and user data may not always be encrypted or stored securely, putting user information at risk. While these systems may provide basic functionalities for secure transactions, they often lack the sophisticated fraud detection and secure authentication required for optimal protection.
Disadvantages:
	Limited Fraud Detection Capabilities: Traditional fraud detection systems often rely on rule-based methods or simplistic models that can be bypassed by advanced fraud tactics. These systems lack the ability to adapt and learn from evolving patterns of fraudulent behavior.
	High False Positive Rate: Rule-based systems may generate a high number of false positives, flagging legitimate transactions as fraudulent, leading to user frustration and loss of trust in the system.
	Lack of Real-Time Monitoring: Existing systems may not provide real-time monitoring, allowing fraudulent transactions to go undetected for a longer time, leading to greater financial losses before detection.
	Insecure Authentication Methods: Basic authentication methods like password-based logins are vulnerable to attacks, such as phishing or brute-force, compromising user data and transaction security.
	Limited Transparency and Accountability: Transaction logs may not be securely stored or easily accessible, limiting transparency and accountability, and making it difficult to track fraudulent activities or resolve disputes.
Proposed system:
The proposed system enhances credit card transaction fraud detection by leveraging advanced machine learning models, including Random Forest, XGBoost, and an Ensemble Model, alongside Explainable AI (XAI) techniques. Random Forest, an ensemble method, improves accuracy by combining multiple decision trees, while XGBoost, a gradient boosting model, excels at handling complex data patterns and large-scale datasets. The Ensemble Model combines both to further improve predictive performance and robustness. To ensure transparency and interpretability, the system incorporates SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations), providing insights into the factors influencing fraud detection decisions. This enables users to understand why a transaction was flagged as fraudulent. The system supports real-time fraud detection, processing each transaction immediately to prevent fraudulent activities before they are completed. Additionally, robust authentication measures, such as multi-factor and biometric verification, safeguard user data, while a comprehensive transaction log ensures transparency. This combination of accurate fraud detection, real-time processing, and explainable AI creates a secure and trustworthy platform for managing credit card transactions.
Advantages
	Enhanced Detection Accuracy: By integrating multiple advanced AI techniques such as BERT, LSTM, GRU, and Random Forest, the proposed system improves the accuracy of detecting cyber terrorism activities, allowing for more reliable identification of threats.
	Reduced False Positive Rates: The combination of machine learning algorithms and ensemble methods minimizes the occurrence of false positives, reducing the burden on cybersecurity teams and allowing them to focus on genuine threats.
	Transparency through Explainable AI: The integration of explainable AI techniques enhances transparency in the detection process, providing stakeholders with clear insights into how decisions are made, which is crucial for trust and accountability in security measures.
